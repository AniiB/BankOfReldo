Fetch the exchange rates of major world currencies at the click of a button. Reldo will get the latest rates!

## Tech used: HTML | CSS | Vanilla JS

My learning was focused on fetching data from an API and then use it to manipulate the DOM.

## Optimizations

Improvements I'd like to add.

- A calculator to convert a user input amount from one currency to another.
- Better CSS animations.


## Lessons Learned:

Learned about the types of data received when an API request is made.
Dynamically adding new elements to the DOM.
